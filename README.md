TropipayJS - A typed SDK for Tropipay Payments API
===========

TropiPay is an electronic wallet that allows you to execute the most common financial operations of the day to day. This is a SDK for Typescript and Javacript that helps you build integrations with the Tropipay platform in a easier way. Can save you a lot of time and effort implementing all the API features. You can use this library with your prefered framework like Express or Nextjs.

# Instalation
You can use npm or yarn to install this package:

`npm install tropipayjs` or
`yarn add tropipayjs`

# How to use
The Tropipay instance allows you to access all the method available in the API. This Object is meant to be used *only* in server side code. Do not use the Tropipay object on the client side (browser). This would expose your app credetials (the client secret of your account). You can create a endpoint at your backend using express and consume it in your frontend, or use SSR if your're using NextJS.

## Setting up your credentials
In order to use the Tropipay API you need to signup in a live (production) or the test enviroment. Create an app and configure the client id an client secret for the app.
